							<h2>An Introduction to my academic work in astronomy</h2>
							<p> The first luminous sources in the universe ionized and heated the majority of hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) in a process called reionization. A detailed description of how exactly reionization took place has yet to be formulated. In particular, current measurements and models of the morphology and timing of end of reionization are still at odds with each other. It is important to understand details of reionization because of its insight into the first sources of ionizing radiation in the universe and the subsequent regulation of galaxy formation (galaxies contain stars and planets like Earth!). It is a vital piece to understanding a nuanced question ubiquitously asked throughout human history: how did we get here? I intend to contribute to the forward progression of solutions addressing this question.</p>

							<p>I received a B.S. in Astronomy & Physics at the University of Washington, Seattle in 2019 where I was an undergraduate research assistant for Professor Matthew McQuinn. I led a study on the thermal history of the IGM using advanced statistical methods and found that hydrogen reionization is complete while helium-II reionization is still ongoing around 2 billion years after the big bang. Read more about it <a href="matt.html">here</a>.</p>
							<p> I joined a physics PhD program at the University of California, Riverside in 2019 where I am currently a graduate student researcher working with Professor Anson Dâ€™Aloisio. I work on radiative transfer simulations to test and build models of hydrogen reionization. The edges of ionized regions, which is the location between an ionized and neutral region, are called ionization fronts (I-fronts) but unfortunately it is challenging for simulations to model the small scale astrophysics of I-fronts while simultaneously accounting for large scale cosmological effects. Therefore, I have developed a detailed model of I-front fluorescence which can be applied to large cosmological simulations. Read more about it <a href="anson.html">here</a>. </p>

							<p>Recently, I have become more interested in the application of machine learning to cosmological simulations. I currently lead a machine learning based project to rapidly and reliably enhance low-resolution dark matter simulations to predict small-scale structure formation in large cosmological volumes. I employ a deep-learning model that decreases computational demand by orders of magnitude in comparison to standard methods while remaining statistically validated on test datasets.</p>

						<h2>Why I am uniquely prepared for a data/research science role outside of academia </h2>
							<p>I am eager to broaden the applicability of my skillset to the industry domain through mentorship and collaboration with experienced industry data scientists. While my industry-specific knowledge is limited, my strong analytic and computational skills developed through my PhD will uniquely allow me to contribute to rapid and effective solutions to real-world business problems. For example, there is common ground between my work optimizing astronomy versus industry big data analysis pipelines; feature engineering astrophysical versus user-experience models; and deep learning in cosmological simulations versus super-resolution imaging in industry. </p>
